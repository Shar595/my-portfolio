        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Career Canvas is an interactive portfolio application designed to showcase
            engineering and technical development projects in a structured and professional format.
            The system demonstrates both front-end design and organized content presentation.

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of Career Canvas was to create a polished and deployable web portfolio
            that highlights engineering skills, project development experience, and technical growth.
            This project reflects practical application of web hosting, structured layout design,
            and project documentation.

        <h2>Engineering Growth & Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Developing Career Canvas strengthened my ability to structure professional
            documentation in a web format and deploy static sites using version control
            and cloud hosting services. This project demonstrates both technical and
            presentation-focused engineering skills.
