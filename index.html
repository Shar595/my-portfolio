        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Sharon, an Engineering Technology student passionate about building
            both hardware and software systems. Through this portfolio project, I strengthened
            my skills in Firebase hosting, authentication systems, AI integration, and real-world debugging.
        </p>
        <p>
            What started as a challenging and nail-biting experience turned into a major learning
            breakthrough in deploying live applications and managing cloud-based systems.
            This project reflects real engineering growth.
