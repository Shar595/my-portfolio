        <h2>Engineering Growth & Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Building ResumeKeeper strengthened my understanding of full-stack development,
            cloud architecture, authentication systems, and AI integration. What initially
            felt overwhelming became a major learning breakthrough in debugging,
            deployment, and managing real-world web application workflows.
